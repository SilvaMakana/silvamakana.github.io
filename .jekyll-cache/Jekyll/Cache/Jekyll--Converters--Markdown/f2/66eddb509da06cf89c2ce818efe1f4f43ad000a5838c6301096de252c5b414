I"”<p>We analyze the linearly polarized absorption effects of the He 1083 nm line from escaping exoplanet atmospheres. The magnetic field of such exoplanets can induce a polarized effect on the absorption profile, which can be calculated in the Stokesâ€™ parameters of the light. The numerical comparison was done the the well-known code HAZEL, which computes the Stokesâ€™ parameters for light passing through a slab of Helium in a magnetic field.</p>
