I"Ö<p>This analysis quantifies the systematic effects of dust in weak lensing survey. We compute the perturbations of the shear power spectrum due to the bias of structures to form in higher dense regions, this leads to the lowest order correction being a third-order moment (bispectrum). We found that different fiducial dust mass distribution models have varying values for the effects on a survey, but the sigificance (as defined by our error metrics) of the effects remain the same for a given wavelength of light.</p>
