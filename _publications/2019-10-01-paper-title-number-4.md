We use three methods for analyzing the fraction of primordial black holes (PBHs) that could be dark matter in the mass range $10^{14}{\rm g} - 10^{19}{\rm g}$ (asteroid-mass): optical microlensing with finite size and diffraction effects, dynamical capture of PBHs in stars using phase space arguments, and destruction of white dwarfs from PBH crossing from hydrodynamic simulations. These three constraints open the possibility that the asteroid-mass range could account for the all the dark matter content.
