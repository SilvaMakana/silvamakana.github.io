We calculate the analytic expression for the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha)$ dissipative quantum electrodynamics (QED) correction to Hawking radiation from asteroid mass PBHs. The spacetime of the black hole, where the mode functions for the photon and spinor fields are computed, is modeled using Schwarzschild (stationary and spherically symmetric). We find the rate of emission of photons escaping to $\infty$ are due to various annihilation, creation, and bremsstrahlung interactions.
