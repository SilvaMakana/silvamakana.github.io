excerpt: 'We calculate the spectropolarimetric effects of magnetic fields on the 1083 nm Helium line found in certain exoplanet atmospheres. We find a strong agreement with the analytic predictions and the numerical simulation (using HAZEL)of different parameters of the linear polarized absorption of this Helium line.'

We analyze the linearly polarized absorption effects of the He 1083 nm line from escaping exoplanet atmospheres. The magnetic field of such exoplanets can induce a polarized effect on the absorption profile, which can be calculated in the Stokes' parameters of the light. The numerical comparison was done the the well-known code HAZEL, which computes the Stokes' parameters for light passing through a slab of Helium in a magnetic field.
