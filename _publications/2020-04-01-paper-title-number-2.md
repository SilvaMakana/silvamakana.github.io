We (four Native Hawaiians) discuss the barriers and obstacles faced while pursing a career in astronomy in Hawaiʻi. These barriers and obstacles are not unquie to us, but are a result of the disconnect with the communities and academic institutes in Hawaiʻi. We discuss our own journeys and bring awareness and possbile resolutions to aid in mitigating these barriers.
